# Disaster-connect
Disaster Connect (Crowdsourced Emergency Web Platform)  An open-source, web-based platform enabling users to report live disaster incidents (with geo-tagged photos or videos) and view them in real-time.  Users can set a notification radius (e.g., 50 km) to receive updates only about nearby incidents—keeping alerts relevant and manageable.
